# ANSIBLE CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT

**AIM OF THIS PROJECT:**

*The aim of this project is to automate routine tasks and appreciate DevOps tools by using Ansible Configuration Management to set up virtual servers, install and configure software, and deploy a web application. The project also focuses on writing code using YAML declarative language. The project introduces the concept of a Jump Server, also known as a Bastion Host, as an intermediary server to provide access to the internal network, where the web servers are located within a secured network that cannot be reached directly from the internet. The project divides the Virtual Private Network (VPC) into two subnets, a Public subnet with public IP addresses and a Private subnet that is only reachable by private IP addresses.*
